            from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
            from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
            from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

Attribute Page:
        - user selects sensitive attributes and privileged or unprivileged groups

Metric Page
        - user selects metrics and sets a threshold

Fairness Results Page:
        - sees the results of the unfair metrics

Algorith Page:
        - user selects mitigation algorithm (trains with the same model as he chose in the beggining)

Algorith Result Page:
        - sees the results of the unfair metrics ( and maybe downloads a new mitigated dataset )
